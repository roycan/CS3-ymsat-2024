      <h1 id="summary">Summary</h1>
      <p>&emsp;Fujioka Haruhi is a middle-class, studious, androgynous-looking girl who got accepted into Ouran Academy— a school where only the children of rich and powerful families study— on a scholarship. One day, while finding a place to study, she stumbles upon a seemingly empty classroom. However, the classroom belongs to the Host Club— a club where 6 handsome and/or cute male students entertain other students which they call their ‘clients’. Wanting to leave immediately, Haruhi accidentally breaks the club’s very expensive vase, thus earning her a ¥8,000,000 debt to the club. Since Haruhi is too poor to pay the debt, the club, not knowing she’s a woman and not a man, notices her being a ‘natural’ entertainer to girls and makes her into a host until she can pay them back by graduation. Though the club eventually finds out her gender, they still decide to keep her as a host. From then on, Haruhi makes friends with both the club members and the clients, all the while hiding her gender from the student body, and some of the hosts (Tamaki, the charming, half-French founder of the host club, and the Hitachiin twins, whom only Haruhi and others can tell apart) also develop feelings for her.</p>

      <div class="description">
        <ul>
          <br>
          <li><b>Fujioka Haruhi</b></li>
          &emsp; &emsp; She is the main character of the show. Haruhi is a very studious,intelligent, and blunt first-year at Ouran Academy, and though considered ‘poor’ by her schoolmates, she is in the middle class. In the host club, she is considered as the “Natural” type of host. She is biologically female, but she believes that gender should not matter, and that only what’s inside counts. She also has astraphobia, a deep fear of thunderstorms.
          <br><br>
          <li><b>Suoh Tamaki</b></li>
          &emsp; &emsp; Tamaki is a second-year in Ouran Academy and is the president and co-founder of the Host Club. He is half-Japanese, half-French. Besides being dramatic and silly, he is also caring and smart— he considers the host club as his family, and he is the second-smartest in his class. In the host club, he is the “Princely” type of host, and 70% of the club’s female clients request him. After graduating from university, he and Haruhi marry.
          <br><br>
          <li><b>Ootori Kyoya</b></li>
          &emsp; &emsp;Being the co-founder of the Host Club, Kyoya is considered the “Shadow King” of the club because it is he who manages the club’s expenses, plans, and activities. He is the “Cool” type of host, mainly due to his charm and well-kept appearance. Kyoya is also very calm and intelligent, being the smartest student in his class with Tamaki. However, he is also cunning and scheming, often finding ways to make the club more money. He is in charge of selling pictures and <i>doujinshi</i>s of the club members and hosting events.
          <br><br>
          <li><b>Hitachiin Hikaru</b></li>
          &emsp; &emsp; Hikaru is the older Hitachiin twin and is classmates with Haruhi. He represents the “Little Devil” type of host, and he and Kaoru offer the “Forbidden Brotherly Love” package to guests. Hikaru may sometimes be possessive of his clubmates, especially Haruhi and Kaoru. He is seen to be more dependent and even childish than his twin. He also falls in love with Haruhi, even offering his headphones to her when she got scared and hid from the thunder.
          <br><br>
          <li><b>Hitachiin Kaoru</b></li>
          &emsp; &emsp; Kaoru is the younger Hitachiin twin and is also classmates with Haruhi. Although he is younger, he is more mature and easy-going than his twin. He also falls in love with Haruhi, but decides to keep quiet about it. He also represents the “Little Devil” type of host, and he and Hikaru would play the game “Which One is Hikaru?” with clients, club members, and family. 
          <br><br>
          <li><b>Haninozuka Mitsukuni</b></li>
          &emsp; &emsp; Haninozuka, or “Honey”, is the “Loli-Shota” type of host and is a third-year student in Ouran Academy. He is very short and likes cute and sweet things. He likes eating cake and often carries around his stuffed bunny, Usa-chan. Although looking like a child, Honey is a martial arts master as he is from a martial arts family. He also mentors his club members and deeply cares for them. He also has two personalities— his Nice and Dark Honey.
          <br><br>
          <li><b>Morinozuka Takashi</b></li>
          &emsp; &emsp; Also called “Mori”, he is the “Strong-Silent” type of host and is the second-oldest host club member. He is good at kendo, as his cousin and best friend is Honey, whom Mori always hangs around with. Mori rarely says anything, and he may look intimidating and stoic, but he is a nice person who likes animals. It is hinted that he likes Haruhi, but the mangaka never showed this much.
