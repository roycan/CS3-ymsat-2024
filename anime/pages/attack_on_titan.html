        <div class="description">
          <p> &emsp; The season introduces the main trio and their odd lives as they grow up surrounded by tall walls that protect them from the feared titans. One day, the outermost wall is broken down and terror strikes in the town of Shiganshina. As the trio witnesses their family and friends be torn to shreds, they make up their minds to become Scouts and avenge their lost loved ones. As they train to become Scouts, viewers are introduced to the rest of the main cast. By the end of the first half, it is revealed that certain people, such as the main character Eren Yeager, can shift into titans. However, they have more power and sanity than regular titans. The Scouts decide to use this to their advantage in battling the titans and retaking the wall. </p>

        <button type="button" class="season">Season 2</button>
        <div class="description">
          <p>&emsp; Now with the newfound information that people can shift into titans, it is brought into question whether there were more people who can do the same. This season reveals that Bertholdt and Reiner, two members of the Scouts, could also shift into titans. However they, along with Annie (who was previously revealed to be a titan shifter), have pledge alleigance to a different goal altogether. They continually try to capture Eren, but fail time and time again.</p>

        <button type="button" class="season">Season 3</button>
        <div class="description">
          <p>&emsp; This season is where they push through with the plan to take back Wall Maria. In their success, they gain control of the Colossal Titan (by killing Bertholdt) and they unlock the basement of Eren's childhood home which contains the secrets of their world. They learn that they are not the only humans left, rather they are one of many races around the world. One of these races, Marleyans, is where Eren's father hails. This is also where Annie, Bertholdt, and Reiner come from. The main characters learn that those with Eldian blood (all of the inhabitants of Paradis and its walls) can be turned into titans with a certain serun. The special titans known as the Nine Titans gain power by consuming those who previously held that power. Eren has the powers of the Attack and Founding Titan as a result of consuming his father who consumed the remaining descendants of the Reiss clan. Historia, another one of the Scouts, was previously revealed to be a Reiss. She has the royal blood that allows Eren to activate his Founding Titan powers. Zeke, the Beast Titan the attcked the group in the previous season, is also revealed to be Eren's brother with royal blood. Historia is crowned the queen of Paradis while the rest of the Scouts prepare to venture to the other side of the wall. </p>

        <button type="button" class="season">Season 4</button>
        <div class="description">
          <p>&emsp; The final season views the previous events through the Marleyans' perspectives. Viewers understand the motivations behind their previous actions and find the gray area in the situation. This season constantly brings up the question on the humanity of their killings, as titans were once human as well. War continues between the two nations and it results in Eren commencing the Rumbling, a move that can only be done with someone of royal blood (Zeke). He plans to exterminate everyone except for the Eldians. He does this with the hope that his friends would obtain freedom by stopping his plan as they would be respected for their feats. The series ends with Eren's death and the short freedom granted by his sacrifice.</p>
