          <p> &emsp; Yumeko Jabami, a second-year student at Hyakkaou Private Academy, appears to be a bright, outgoing, and attractive high school student who recently transferred. However, she is a compulsive gambler who bets only for the thrill of it‚Äîunlike the other Hyakkaou students who bet for social or financial gain. Unafraid of rules or logic and possessing a keen eye for gambling scams, Yumeko swiftly upsets the school's hierarchy and catches the attention of the Student Council, whose president, Kirari Momobami, becomes interested in her.</p>

          <h3> ‚≠ê Jabami Yumeko ‚≠ê </h3>
              <p>A mysterious transfer student in Hyakkaou Private Academy who has straight black hair with bangs. She seems to have a  modest and elegant appearance, but beneath that docile nature, Yumeko hides a psychotic addiction to gambling. She has good gambling skills and can quickly turn the tables to her advantage once in a game.</p>
          
          <h3> ‚ô†Ô∏è Mary Saotome ‚ô†Ô∏è </h3>
              <p>She‚Äôs a student in Yumeko and Ryota‚Äôs class. She has a 
     distinct blonde hair that is styled in pigtails and a sassy personality. The student who first challenged the protagonist to a gambling game. She, later on, loses to Jabami and becomes a house pet (people who don‚Äôt get to pay their losses and are now treated as the lowest of the lows).</p>
          
          <h3> ‚ô£Ô∏è Kirari Momobami ‚ô£Ô∏è </h3>
              <p>he current council president of the academy and the main antagonist. Kirari Momobami was the person who created the infamous house pet system that is similar to the Apartheid system, the only difference is that this is applied to the losers who lost from gambling and are unable to pay their debts. She has striking blue eyes and white hair that she wears in two knotted rings. Kirari looks like a refined and proper council president on the outside, but she is very calculating and manipulative with a very narcissistic personality.
