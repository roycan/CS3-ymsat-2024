        <div class="description">
          <p> &emsp; This season covers the Port Mafia Arc and teases the Guild Arc. The first half introduces the anime‚Äôs main characters and main villains (for this arc/season). It starts with orphan Atsushi Nakajima after he has been kicked out of his orphanage. By the river bank, he meets an odd man named Osamu Dazai and his workmate Doppo Kunikida. They treat him to a meal and reveal that they are part of the renowned special ability organization named the Armed Detective Agency (ADA). They also reveal that they are on the hunt for a white tiger that has been wreaking havoc. Since Atsushi infers that the tiger has been following him, he accompanies Dazai to a warehouse that they determined to be the beast‚Äôs next stop. There, it is revealed that the white tiger is Atsushi in his ability form. Dazai uses his nullification ability to prevent Atsushi from attacking him and waits for the rest of the Agency members to arrive. The first half focuses on introducing the rest of the Agency and some members of the opposing organization, the Port Mafia (PM). The second half focuses on Atsushi‚Äôs attempts to save the Port Mafia‚Äôs assassin Kyoka Izumi from the Mafia‚Äôs, specifically Ryunosuke Akutagawa‚Äôs, influence. After a battle between Atsushi and Akutagawa, the Agency succeeds in recruiting Kyoka. Earlier in the season,  it was stated that the PM‚Äôs motivation to kidnap Atsushi was due to a bounty placed on him. By the end of the season, it is revealed to be placed by The Guild, the second season‚Äôs main villain.</p>

          <p>&emsp; hThe first four episodes mark the start of the anime adaptation of the light novels. In this season, it covers the Dark Age arc, delving into Dazai‚Äôs past in the Port Mafia. The viewers learn the reason behind Dazai‚Äôs departure from the organization and his transfer to the ADA. The rest of the season focuses on the tri-organization war between the ADA, PM, and Guid.  The Book‚Äôs existence is introduced as a blank book with pages that can turn whatever is written into reality as long as it follows a consistent narrative. Fitzgerald, the Guild‚Äôs leader, aims to use this book to resurrect his dead daughter. To do so, he requires Atsushi‚Äôs presence due to his connection to the Book. Through Dazai‚Äôs manipulation of the situation, Atsushi and Akutagwa reluctantly team up to defeat the Guild. The season ends with Kyoka officially becoming a member and a teaser for the show‚Äôs next major villain. </p>

        <button type="button" class="season">Season 3, 4, & 5</button>
        <div class="description">
          <p>&emsp; The last three seasons (as of January 2024) all focus on the Agency‚Äôs fight against Fyodor Dostoevysky and his associates. The third season starts with the adaptation of the light novel Dazai, Chuuya, Age Fifteen. These first three episodes focus on Dazai and Chuuya‚Äôs first meeting and the origin of their partnership. The rest of the season adapted the Cannibalism arc. Fyodor causes immense distress among the ADA and PM as he orders an ability user to place a virus onto the organization‚Äôs leader, rendering them bedridden. Once again, Atsushi and Akutagawa team up to defeat the enemy. Fyodor escapes unscathed until Dazai outsmarts him and has him arrested with the help of Fitzgerald.<br>
            &emsp; The fourth season starts with the adaptation of the light novel The Untold Origins of the Detective Agency. These first three episodes focus on Ranpo and Fukuzawa‚Äôs first meeting and the founding of the Agency as a result of their encounter. The rest of the season follows the ADA as they are on the run from the government ability user group named the Hunting Dogs after they are framed for various crimes. The Decay of Angels, the organization Fyodor is part of, is responsible for framing the ADA after using a page from the Book to rewrite the public‚Äôs perception of the Agency. The fifth season immediately follows this plot line. Ochi Fukuchi, the leader of the Hunting Dogs, is revealed to be the true leader of the Decay of Angels. Atsushi and Akutagawa team up once more to defeat him, but the battle ends with Akutagawa‚Äôs beheading and Fukuchi‚Äôs escape. A vampire in the Decay of Angels named Bram spreads his vampirism across Yokohama with Fukuchi‚Äôs control. While all of this is taking place, Dazai is arrested and placed in jail with Fyodor. In a race to escape, Dazai wins and through his and Ranpo‚Äôs actions, the vampirism stops and Fukuchi dies in Fukuzawa‚Äôs arms. All of this along with Fyodor‚Äôs apparent demise gives the impression that all is well once more, however, the season ends with a scene of a ruined battlefield and Atsushi and a visibly undead Akutagawa fighting against an unknown being. </p>
