## Features Extension: Forms Implementation (Added)
1. HTML forms will be used for a dedicated Login page (and a Sign-up page to use when the person doesn't have an account yet) for users, and a review page (A page where users can leave ratings and comments about the website). The existence of a review page calls for an account, thus the reason why we plan to implement login/sign-up pages as well.
2. Data saved for login pages will be the username of the user and the password of the account, essentially the credentials;
   the Sign-up page will initially have the Data needed for the login pages, as you are still setting up your account, including a few other collected information such as gender and a text area to enter the reason why they visited the website.
   As for the website review pages, we will be collecting a Likert-scale based rating of the website from 1 (not impressive) to 5 (commendable), and separate text areas for improvement suggestions, strong points of the website, and other messages that the user wants to convey. To track this survey information, the account used will be associated with the review sent.
3. For the HTML Input types to be used, we will only be using a variety of text fields such as expandable text areas, normal text fields, and password fields, radio buttons, and some checkboxes.
4. A wireframe of a login page is presented below:
   ![LoginPage](images/login_wireframe.png)
5.Layout Improvement Suggestion: we will be making images a bit bigger and clearer to see, and put figcaptions on all of them (any kind of text that describes/cites the images as well). We Will also correct the backgrounds of the pages by putting images/colors instead for a better user appeal.
