      <h6 class="text-uppercase fw-bold text-start">Nicholas II</h6>
      <p>The last Tsar of Russia. He was the grandson of Alexander II, known for his reforms and abolishment of serfdom, and the son of Alexander III, known for the reversal of Alexander II’s previous reforms. Reigning from 1894 to his abdication in March of 1917, he tried modernizing the country by enacting reforms set by prime ministers Sergei Witte and Pytor Stoylpin. However, his staunch opposition to giving the Duma a more larger administrative role, and overall stalwartness to maintaining the autocracy, led the Russian Empire into decline and pandemonium. After his abdication, he and his family were taken by local Bolsheviks to Yekaterinburg in the Urals, where they were slaughtered in July 1918, in order to prevent White Russian forces closing in on the area to save the royal family.</p>

      <h6 class="text-uppercase fw-bold text-start">Vladimir Lenin</h6>
      <p>A Russian revolutionary and political theorist who was the founder and first head of government of Soviet Russia from 1917 to 1924, and later of the Soviet Union from 1922 to 1924. After replacing the rule of the tsars, he transformed Russia into a one-party state influenced by Marxist and Socialist ideals, as well as building a cult of personality. Despite his death in 1924, he is still considered a polarizing figure in the 20th century: as one who brought communism and change to the old order, but one who also began Russia’s descent into totalitarianism once more.

    <div>
      <h6 class="text-uppercase fw-bold text-start">Leon Trotsky</h6>
      <p> Another revolutionary leader who was the founder of the Red Army, or the Soviet military. Known for his skills in oratory and political theory, it was said that in the aftermath of the revolution, he was considered Lenin’s second in command. However, he lacked the skills needed to survive the cutthroat politics of Soviet Russia. Later on, he was politically ostracized by his rival, Joseph Stalin, leading to the former’s deportation from the Soviet Union in 1929. He was assassinated by Soviet agent Ramon Mercader in 1940, while he was living in Mexico.

  <div class="noImage">
    <h6 class="text-uppercase fw-bold text-start">Socialism</h6>
    <p>Economy where the means of production and property is controlled by the people and overall community, which coordinates said control over these means. Every proponent considered socialism as a stepping stone to communism, and among these proponents was Lenin. </p>
  </div><br>
  <div class="noImage">
    <h6 class="text-uppercase fw-bold text-start">Communism</h6>
    <p>A more absolute form of socialism, where private property is abolished entirely. All objects and decisions are made with participation from all levels of society, with social classes virtually abolished.</p>
