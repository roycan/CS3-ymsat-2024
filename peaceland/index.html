    <br> <h4>By the 20th century, Russia was falling behind. </h4> <p>As other European nations began industrialization and the gradual transition from feudalism and absolute monarchy to capitalism and democracy began, the Tsar, Nicholas II stubbornly held on to all the influence in the empire, massively contributing to the stagnation of the empire’s power. The fruits of this antiquated and obsolescent style of rule reared their ugly head when Russia found itself humiliated by Japan in 1905, and later by the German-led Central Powers in WW1. These wars put a strain on the already disillusioned and disgruntled people, and resentment towards Nicholas and his so-called divine right grew even more. They had already tried to revolt - after their defeat at the hands of the Japanese, they forced the Tsar himself to cede some power to a parliament called the Duma - but eventually, they realized that if any progress was to be made in running the country, a new system would be implemented. <br><br>

    It was also around this time that Germany, sensing the possibility to knock Russia out of the war by taking advantage of their instability, sent a radical Russian expatriate to St. Petersburg, who brought with him the ideas that would bring in the change Russians so badly wanted.
