    <h2>Why We Made This Website</h2>
    <p>
      The quick answer is that mental health is one of the more prevalent problems in this generation, especially with the rise of social media and other beliefs. We wanted to make this website look friendly but also take a look at the human condition and see that many of us are struggling. We want to make this website accessible and not too drawn out like other websites, while also being easy to navigate. We also had no time to think of another topic for the website so...
    <br>
    <br>
      Though, don't let this distract from the fact that we really do want to help in educating, so let this simple website be a simple guide to a complex concept!
