## JS Incorporation
### Note: All Changes are either in **bold** or in **`this form`**
- Buttons: JS is needed in order to customize and create the buttons so that they will be functional in a way that they would serve their purpose (to go to a different page).
  
- **`Multimedia`**: **The website will have videos in it (like trailers) and audios. JS can be used to put these multimedia files in our website when we want to control when the audio/video can and not play. For example, it must play when mouse is hovered over, otherwise, it will pause.**
- **`Carousel effect/Image Sliders`**: **These kinds of effect can be implemented using JS Bootstrap as well as the use of arrays.**
- **`Multi-step Forms`**: **We plan to use javascript for the incorporation of a multi-step form (see IndivMovie 3,4,5) for getting information about the user and their review about a specific movie. The form will have multi-tabs in one page, instead of creating another page for the form in order to save time and less hassle for the user to answer the form. We will use javascript for the control of tabs, validation of content, and display of the content from the form.**


## Outline and features 
The website will include the following pages and features:
- Home page: with an introduction and highlights of what the website is about. In this case, it is about Greta Gerwig. There will be menu bar on top where the creator's logo and other links for the webpages** (ex. About Us page, View movies page, About Greta Gerwig page) will be located.
