## Description
This website will let users create their cards. They get to choose their own text color and background color. On the homepage, some examples of the cards will be showcased. On the homepage, a series of cards will be shown as examples that will entice new users to interact and utilize our services. These can then be downloaded and used as a concise and summarized introduction to themselves, an OC, someone else, etc.

## Description of JS use
The javascript part of our website will be used to function in the creation of one's card. This part of the coding will be placed in the resources folder. This will be used to save the final output of the person's card. **In addition to these, each box in the form will be marked required if the box is not filled. This will also save your details using the submit button in the login or sign-up form. Once the user has made an account, their main page will be the "My Gallery" page, where they can view saved profiles once they start creating.**

- Home page with an introduction to the website and its purpose
