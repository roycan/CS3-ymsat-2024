## 3rd Quarter Proposal

1. Logical and Appropriate Implementation of Forms

Visitors of the page are able to show their love for the band member they resonate the most with! We're going to add a voting system so fans of the band can show their love fo their bias to the whole world!

2. Diverse Use of Form Elements

We plan to implement both option and textarea elements in our form. The former will be used to know the visitor's favorite band member while the latter will be used if the visitor wants to send them a message. 

3. Forms Spans Several Pages

Instead of the form spanning several pages, we have decided to put a button that shows the results specifically the percentages of people who voted for their favorite band member.

4. Identification of Data to be Saved on User's Computers and Identification of Information that can be Derived from the Saved Data

The website will save the user's choice on the form and will have another page which shows the results based on what the user picked. This graph will compare how many times each member has been chosen as the public's favorite. For the messages, the website will output the messages in the results page together with the picture of their favorite band member.

5. One or Two Wireframes of Added Webpages

We are thinking of adding 2 more webpages to our website to further extend it's services. One of them details the latest news happening with the band like major announcements, upcoming albums, fresh gigs, etc. The second page will be about their media, stuff like short recordings of performances, music videos, photos, etc. While we already had such elements scattered throughout the website, we think it would be a better idea to consolidate them into one page.

6. Improvement suggestion on the layout of the website (up to 2pt bonus)

We will add appropriate media queries to elements that need it to keep our website look good even if it is resized. Also, we plan to add small details to the website especially the store page so that it can look more pleasing to the visitors.
