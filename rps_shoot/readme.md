# Website Title
Rock, Paper, Scissors, Shoot!
## Description
  Using an AI (the program) as their opponents, users can play the classic game "Rock Paper Scissors Shoot" online at this website. The website provides a background/history of the game and familiarize the user with the weapons/options they can use in a match. This website serves 2 modes or types of battles, and will provide the instructions for each mode of battle. Although the home page has all of these, there are subpages for each that offers more information. All subpages are linked in the navigation area, and the homepage is linked to the logo found in the heading. 
  
  The first mode is "Infinite Matches" wherein the user will battle in unlimited matches against an AI, with no tally of scores gained by any of the party. The second mode is "First to Three", wherein the user will compete against an AI until one party wins 3 matches; the match count isn't technically limited to 5 because a draw could occur. In contrast to the first mode, the second mode will record the points gained by each party.

**`Add description on how and where JS will be used/incorporated in your website`**
  JS will be used in managing user interactions during battles against the AI opponent. Functions will be used to handle the logic behind these. It will process user inputs, determining the outcomes of each match to identify whether the player or the AI won. Additionally, it will be incorporated in updating and recording the points earned by the player or the AI after each battle, contributing to the overall game scores. This is significant in the "First to Three" mode as it ensures accurate tracking of points earned and manage possible results like draws.

  Furthermore, it can be used in adding effects when the player choose a weapon or when the AI opponent reveals its choice which adds to the excitement to the gaming experience which can be done by displaying message or animation. The use of displaying message or animation can also be employed to signify the outcome of each match to make the game more visually appealing and engaging.

  **Additionally, it will be used for the forms. For the inputs of the required information about the player, it can be used to handle form events and use functions using attributes. It will also be used in updating the form elements or display. If the required fields weren't been answered by the player, there will be an alert in which JS will be incorporated as well. Another thing, JS will be used when welcoming the player by their nickname on the different webpages.**

## Objectives
The objectives of the website are:
- Provide a platform for people to play 'Rock, Paper, Scissors, Shoot!' virtually
- To help people ease boredom by offering an entertaining online game
- Strategically choose between rock, paper, and scissors each round, aiming to defeat the AI opponent and earn points

## Target Audience
The target audience for the website includes:
- All people of all ages that wants to ease their boredom with an online website to play a classic game
- Lonely people who still want to play interactive games

## Development Approach
The website will be developed using the following technologies and tools:
- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for front-end development
- Responsive design frameworks like w3.css or Bootstrap
- Version control system (e.g., Git or replit) for collaboration and code management
- Canva and possibly Youtube to create visual aids

## Improvement Suggestion
-**For improvement of the layout, we can experiment more on the font or adding designs. We think that our website's layout is okay, but it looks a bit plain and simple. We can fix this by looking for better fonts or designs we can add on the website to make it look more appealing.**
-**One major thing we have to work on is making our website responsive which means that we have to edit a lot in CSS so that it will work and look the same regardless of the gadget used. Right now, the layout changes when we try using it by phone.**
- **Another thing we could fix is the footer. Though we've had exercises in which we had this layout where we put the footer at the bottom right, maybe instead of a having just a line of text, we can have an actual section for it at the bottom, still position fixed.**
- **Lastly, for the navigation menu, it might be better to make it fixed at the top so the user won't have to scroll or go to the top to go to another webpage. It would also make it look more "professional" or like the standard layout of websites.**
