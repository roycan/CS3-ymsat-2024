    <p style="margin: auto;padding:0px 10%;text-align:justify;"> <br>Are you looking for a thrilling game where you want to challenge your luck? This is the right mode for you! In this game mode, you will be playing against the computer. The computer will choose a random weapon and you will choose a weapon of your choice. The match will end when either you or the AI reaches 3 points, but if you want a rematch, you can press the "Rematch" button to have another round of this mode. If enter button is clicked after a party having 3 wins, there will be an alert box to inform that the game has ended. If you press OK or enter, the game will automatically reset and present to you another rematch.
