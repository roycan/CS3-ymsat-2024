# Website Title
Rock Paper Scissors Shoot! 

## Description
In the main content area, there will be the introduction and the instructions of a game. Then, there will be a button under, where when pressed, the JS code will be triggered. There will be two types or kinds of games. 

First, is called "Infinite Matches" wherein the user will battle with the randomized code (AI) in unlimited matches. When the button for this is pressed, there will be a prompt that will ask the user what it wants to be or use against the AI. The code will then randomly choose a picture(rock, paper, scissors). Then, the program will compare the two pictures and declare a winner unless it's a draw. There will be an option to reset and the user will get to play another match with the AI/code. Thus, the name infinite matches as it can generate a match non-stop and won't track the number of wins or losses.

The second type of game is "Best of Three" wherein the user will battle with the program until the user or the AI reaches or gains three wins. The process is pretty much the same as the user will be asked by a prompt to choose a weapon, the AI will randomly choose a weapon, and the two weapons will be compared. However, in this game, there will be a tally of the scores which will be updated everytime a party wins. The objective is for the user to get 3 wins first and will end the game. A message will also appear, either "You won" or "You lost". We plan to have a button to reset and play another set of matches.

In the navigation area, there will be the game's logo and name, background of the game, and the two modes. We might try to have the picture change every time it gets clicked. (Pictures: logo, rock, paper, and scissors)

The footer will include our details for inquiries or concerns. 

This proposal outlines the design and development plan for a new website.
