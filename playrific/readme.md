# Playrific

## Description
This proposal outlines the design and development plan for a new website.

**`Our website will feature multiple mini games for the user to play. Using Javascript, we will replicate the games "Rock, Paper, Scissors!", "Finding Floppa", and "Guess the Number". Once a user has won a game, they will earn stars. The website will include a navigation bar, the contact details of the makers of the website, and an "About Us" page.**

## Outline and features
The website will include the following pages and features:

1. **`Sign-up page`**

  - **Accepts the player's name (through a text box) along with an image that will be taken as the player's avatar throughout the game.**
  - **The player's name, avatar, and current number of stars will be displayed in a modal box once the player has won.**
  - **Includes a submit and reset button.**
  
2. **`Homepage`**

- It includes the navigation for all pages, the logo, and shortcuts to the mini games that are featured in the website. These mini games are "Guess the Number!" and "Rock, Paper, Scissors!".
- This also includes a navigation bar that is also accessible in all the other webpages.

3. **`About Us page`**

- This page provides brief background information about the company.

4. **`Guess The Number! page`**
    - First mini game
    - *`Mechanics`*:
        - **The user picks between easy mode, medium mode, or hard mode through radio buttons.**
        - Easy mode:
          A random number is generated from 1-10.
        - **Medium mode:**
          **A random number is generated from 1-15.**
        - Hard mode:
          A random number is generated from **1-20.**
        - The user is given 5 attempts to guess the correct number. **They will input their answer using a number form and will be submitted with a submit button.**
        - For every attempt, the program tells the user whether their answer is higher or lower than the correct number.
        - **If the user wins: easy mode, they get 1 star; medium mode, they get 2 stars; hard mode, they get 3 stars.**
  
5. **`Rock, Paper, Scissors! Page`**
    - Second mini game
    - *`Mechanics`*
      - The user plays against the computer.
      - The user picks between rock, paper, and scissors **using radio buttons and will submit through a submit button.**
      - The computer is programmed to generate a random choice among the three.
      - **The user gets a star every win.**

6. **`Finding Floppa`****
    - **Third mini game**
    - ***`Mechanics`***
      - **The user has 3 tries to find the floppa within a background image.**
