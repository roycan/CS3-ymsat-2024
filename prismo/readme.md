# Prismo

## Description
Prismo is a website that's all about two things: games and colors. Inside, you'll find four unique games that will test your knowledge on color and color theory. With this, you can test yourself on how well you really know your ABCs and RGBs. No pressure though, since the goal in every game is, ultimately, to have fun :] 

**`JavaScript will be used heavily in designing our games. This ensures an interactive experience for the user. Since this website is all about colors, we expect to make use of CSS manipulation via JS. Moreover, JS will also be used to navigate across webpages through reponsive sidebars.`**
