# FocusFlare

## Description
  FocusFlare is a productivity, task and time management tool to aid users in planning and accomplishing their tasks. The website has two tools, PomoPulse and TaskTracker. The PomoPulse contains a pomodoro timer that helps organize a user's time through a series of working and break cycles. The TaskTracker consists of a task planner, sorter, dashboard and calendar to organize and plan activities.

  FocusFlare aims to help students, teachers, professionals, and especially individuals suffering from disorders like ADHD and ADD. Together with our interactive user-interface, we can improve the focus, as well as, provide helpful insight on time management to our dear users. We use tools such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript to develop a website for user accessibility and usage.
