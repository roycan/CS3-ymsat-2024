        <h2>SYNOPSIS</h2>
        <p>Adapted from William Shakespeare's play "The Taming of the Shrew," 10 Things I Hate About You starts off with
          Cameron, new student at Padua High, sitting in the office of the quirky guidance counselor Ms. Perky. He is
          then shown around the school by Michael, who will become his best friend. During his tour is when Cameron
          first sees Bianca Stratford, a beautiful sophomore with one problem: she isn't allowed to date. And neither is
          her "shrew" sister, Katarina, a senior who loves indie rock and feminist prose and hates conformity. But Kat
          and Bianca's father alters his house rule: now, Bianca can date... as long as Kat has a date, too. Now, in
          order for Cameron to date Bianca, he has to find someone to date Kat. So Michael helps him enlist the help of
          pretty-boy/jerk/model Joey Donner, tricking him into thinking that *he* will get to take Bianca out if he pays
          someone to take out Kat. His choice: Patrick Verona, a bad-boy with a mysterious reputation--some say he ate a
          live duck once, others that he lit a state trooper on fire, and even more claim that he had a brief adult film
          career. Will Patrick win Kat's heart? Will Cameron win Bianca's? Or will everything hit the fan...?</p>

              <p>★★★★★ <br>you'd think that someone who watches at least one romcom a month would feel "numb" over a stereotypical trope, but you're WRONG! "cringy stereotypical romcom" is my FAVORITE guilty pleasure. this movie is no different, either. i LOVE this movie,, from the dialogue to the chemistry to the soundtrack to literally EVERYTHING!! the thing is it really isn't all that different from other 00's romcoms, but this one is in my favorites. Why? I honestly can't pinpoint it either. what i can pinpoint, though, is that the scene where kat read her poem broke me, and it's one of my favorite monologues ever <3 </p>

              <p>★★★★★ <br>an (almost) pure ball of sunshine, one of, if not, the best rom-coms of all time. plotwise,
                it's a pretty ordinary movie, but somehow they pull it off amazingly, making it a classic. julia stiles
                and heath ledger have amazing on-screen chemistry, with both of them being so very charming. it's the
                perfect movie for when you just wanna lift your spirits and all. kinda the perfect (comfort) movie.</p>
