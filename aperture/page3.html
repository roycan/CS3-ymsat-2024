        <p>Charlie is a shy teenager without friends that has just joined the high-school. He misses his best friend,
          who had committed suicide, and he writes letters to an imaginary friend telling his feelings. Further, Charlie
          has a mental illness problem in his past. Soon Charlie befriends the veterans Patrick, who is gay, and his
          stepsister Sam and they become best friends. Charlie wants to be a writer and he also becomes the favorite
          student of his teacher of literature, Mr. Anderson, who lends him books. Sam and Patrick introduce Charlie to
          their friends and Charlie falls in love with Sam, but he does not have self-confidence to date her. Charlie
          discovers a new world and feels happy with his friends, and he dates their common friend Mary Elizabeth. But
          when they end their relationship, Patrick asks Charlie to stay away from them for a while and soon he triggers
          his mental illness again. He goes to the hospital where a doctor finally discloses the origin of his problem.

              <p>‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ <br> this movie was something that i didn't know i needed. i watched the movie without knowing what it was about, and i ended the movie crying!! it felt very 'warm'; it made me feel as if i was inside the movie itself?? i don't really know how to explain it, but it just made me feel very deeply for each character, even if they're fictional. the characters in the movie have gone through alot, but eventually get better. the movie makes me think that, in the future, i'll get better, too!</p>

              <p>‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ <br> i personally love this movie so much because of the atmosphere. it talked about very sensitive topics with such delicateness and, thankfully, had a good and happy ending. also, i love both tunnel scenes because they just feel immaculate, like i wanna experience that too!!</p>
