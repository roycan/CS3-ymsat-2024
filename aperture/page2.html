        <h2>SYNOPSIS</h2>
        <p>Much to his surprise, timid Joel Barish is shocked to discover that the love of his life, sparky Clementine,
          has had him erased from her memory. As a result, hurt and angry, Joel wants to pay her back in the same coin,
          going as far as to undergo a painless but intricate medical procedure to do the same. However, poor Joel is
          utterly unaware that darkness is an essential part of the light. And as the once-cherished recollections of
          Clementine gradually fade away, giving way to a soulless black void, something unexpected happens. Now Joel
          has second thoughts, toying with the idea of stopping the irreversible process. Who said ignorance is bliss?

              <p>★★★★★ <br> i like how the movie's timeline is confusing at first, but it makes sense as you watch the movie. i also like the cinematography of the movie especially when Joel's memories are being erased. There are times where objects and people just disappear and cuts to the next memory. as Joel's complete memory erasure approaches, there's a unique shift in light where the background gets darker, and it solely focuses on Joel and Clementine. meanwhile, there's also increasingly disturbing/eerie background music playing (it's quite scary actually). the way i interpret this is i believe it's to showcase how Joel feels about the erasure. these eerie changes signify how irritated, and frustrated Joel was as the memory erasure continued. the movie is a rollercoaster of emotions that are centered on these two imperfect people trying to make their reationship work before and after their memory erasures. my favorite scene was the final memory; where Joel admits he wish he'd stayed. </p>
