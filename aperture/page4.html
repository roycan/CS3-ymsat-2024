        <h2>SYNOPSIS</h2>
        <p>Painfully shy Todd Anderson has been sent to the school where his popular older brother was valedictorian.
          His roommate, Neil Perry, although exceedingly bright and popular, is very much under the thumb of his
          overbearing father. The two, along with their other friends, meet Professor Keating, their new English
          teacher, who tells them of the Dead Poets Society, and encourages them to go against the status quo. Each does
          so in his own way, and is changed for life.</p>

              <p>★★★★★ <br>(SPOILERS) when i saw after the movie, what i thought of the most was how subtle the hints pointing to neil's suicide were. honestly, it made me feel anxious. what if someone dear to me was experiencing the same thing and i noticed too late? then, i remembered how neil's friends felt. todd running as if to escape from the realization that neil died, then vomitting after he processed it. the movie with its amazing visuals, characters and plot made it one of the most devastating movies that i've watched.</p>

              <p>★★★★★ <br>this movie is one that has a special place in my heart. everything about it is perfect--the setting, the soundtrack, the dialogue, the plot. robin williams played mr. keating almost perfectly, becoming one of the most inspiring, charismatic and endearing characters ever to grace the world. apart from all these, i loved the very subtle romance seen between neil and todd. ethan hawke (todd) provided one of the best performances, especially towards the end. i love this movie so much (it made me sad for like a whole week because of neil and todd).</p>
