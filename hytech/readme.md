## ***Project Redesign***
1. ***The sign-in button will be situated on the right-most part of the header, leading to the first page when clicked. It will be separate from the tabs and colored differently for better emphasis. As a result, the header will be scaled down appropriately to distribute the distinct parts, ensuring efficient use of space.***
2. ***We will utilize input tags of various types, such as text, password, email,  radio, and more. The diversity and appropriate implementation of inputs would make the forms effective and less repetitive.***
3. ***Varying in content, the first page focuses on user identification, while the second page revolves around user background. Both will have similar designs different from the aesthetic of the rest of the web pages to achieve consistency and distinction.***
4. ***The users' computers will save required identification, including their username, email, and password, and optional opinionated responses on The Legend of Zelda series. The former will distinguish the individuals who accessed the website, allowing us to detect unwanted spam accounts or people not under the management of the administrator at pshs.edu.ph. On the other hand, the latter will display the diversity of each person's knowledge and experiences with the franchise, developing interaction and connection.***
5. ***View the wireframes of the added web pages, namely 4_Form_1.png and 5_Form_2.png.***
6. ***Based on the suggestions, several improvements can be made to the website’s layout. One, next to the services tab, there will be a reference list tab. Two, the title will be merged with the icon into one long image to prevent it from overflowing when zoomed in. It will use a Zelda font for more emphasis. Three, the next and previous buttons will be formatted on the right to match the overall look, with additional text below for an explanation. As such, the image will be scaled down for more space and improved readability. Lastly, each page will be rechecked for typographical errors to improve the flow and writing.***
