# MBTIles (Website Title)

## Description
This proposal outlines the design and development plan for a new website.

The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator, or MBTI, is a tool used to determine a person's preferences, strengths, and weaknesses as well as their personality type. It is currently one of the most popular psychological instruments. Using four dichotomies—Extraversion vs. Introversion, Sensing vs. Intuition, Thinking vs. Feeling, and Judging vs. Perceiving—the assessment assigns people to one of 16 personality types.

We created this website so that people might explore information about their own MBTI and gain insights that would help them in their day-to-day life. MBTIs are widely used in a variety of contexts, including self-reflection, team building, and career development.

How JS will be used/incorpoated in our website:
- Onclick function
- Navigation (Transitions, scroll)
- To make a list of your friends' MBTIs

## Outline and features
The website will include the following pages and features (examples only below):
- Home page with clickable .pngs that will show the information on the MBTI type clicked on. This info could include the corresponding cognitive function, an explanation for that MBTI type, etc.
- An "about the cognitive functions" page that includes the necessary information to gain a sufficient understanding of the topic, like what cognitive functions are, the cognitive traits, etc.
- Page for compatibility between MBTIs

## Forms implementation
- **A register page for users to make their own profile**
- **Pop up box for old users to enter their username and password**

**Note: the new wireframes for the forms implementation will be in the images folder under "images/forms implementation wireframes"**
