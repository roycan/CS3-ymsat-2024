# The Hamilton World

## Description
This website aims to inform and present different aspects of the musical 'Hamilton' to both new and returning viewers of the musical. It aims to increase the online presence of the Hamilton, provide a platform where uses can learn more about Hamilton through blogs and quizzes, and give information about Hamilton the musical. 

Through this website, there are three different webpages which are (1) the Homepage, (2) About Hamilton: Acts 1 and 2, and (3) Hamilton: Quizzes and Puzzles. The first two webpages are where users may get informed about the different aspects of Hamilton in both acts, and the third webpage is where our JS incorporation enters. Users may interact with the webpage through the answering and solving of different puzzles and quizzes about Hamilton with things like. Through the use of popup features, we will be able to maximize our three page website. 

**From these webpages, several changes have been decided for the Quarter 3 project - mostly revolving around reformatting the forms in the quiz games and redesigning the About It section into a feature section for Hamilton. To do this, the original About It section will be turned into a trailer section wherein different links of different articles together with their teasers would be placed. This was decided to lessen the amount of text in a given webpage as well as to provide more content for the website.**

**As for the second change, the quizzes format will be completely eradicated in such a way that all questions in a quiz will appear individually. This is done to give the website a better, neater, and more comfortable environment. Together with this, an algorithm change was decided for one quiz namely the 'Which Hamilton Character Are You?'. Originally, the method of getting the resulting character was through a summation of all values of chosen answers. However, the pair decided to make use of the mode of all values instead as it will show more insights on which character they're most frequently like. Through these changes, we hope to make our webiste better and more polished.**

**To keep data belonging to the user in this website, local storages will be used in the group's Games and Quizzes part. In this regard, users may input a username of their choice before answering any of the games. Here, their data will be saved as a whole if they decide to revisit or reanswer the tests. As long as the same username is placed, it will be remembered by the website in the games and quizzes portion.**
