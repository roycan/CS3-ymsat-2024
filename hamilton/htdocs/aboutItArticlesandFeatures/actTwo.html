      <p> The second act of Hamilton talks about Hamilton's life with his name on the line together with his eventual demise. The act opens up with a dramatic entrance from Thomas Jefferson. For most of the 1780s and the war, Thomas Jefferson had been in France, but now he is back ready to become secretary of state. His return leads to James Madison, his friend, to catch him up on his 'hatred' for Hamilton. Madison also warns Jefferson about Hamilton's plans and how overreaching they can become. </p> 
      
      <p> Later, a cabinet battle ensues. Hamilton and Jefferson argue about the prospects of opening a national bank. This argument later gets shut down by Washington altogether. Hamilton goes on about how terrible it is that Jefferson and Madison are seemingly ganging up on him while Washington just tells him that winning a war is much easier than actually governing the winners.  </p>

      <p> Escaping from the work scene, the next part opens up about Hamilton's home and family life. Angelica is pensive about her recent letter from Hamilton and the seemingly mistaken location of a comma. Meanwhile, Hamilton's son - Philip - turns 9 years old and performs a poem. All the while, Eliza urges Hamilton to take a break and enjoy his life with his family in her father's lake house. This is further done by both Angelica and Eliza, but Hamilton refuses by claiming he has too much work to do. </p>
      
      <p> However, while his family is on vacation, a woman comes to meet him - Maria Reynolds. Hamilton offers her a loan, but he also realizes that she's seducing him. He continously tells himself to say no, but he ends up starting an affair with her. This is later discovered by Maria's husband who blackmails Hamilton. If Hamilton does not give money, his secret will be revealed. </p>

      <p>Back to the work scene, we meet again with Aaron Burr. Burr is curious as to how Hamilton's new debt plan would work. However, Hamilton tells him that the former decided to follow his advice - 'Talk less, smile more'. After this, Hamilton has a meeting with Jefferson and Madison - excluding Burr. Burr realizes that he deeply disliked the exclusion made upon him. He realized that he wanted to be part of the action too. Here, he decided to run for a senator slot - ultimately defeating Philip Schuyler. </p>
      <p> After this, a second cabinet battle ensues. This time, it was about supporting France in their own war against Britain. In the end, Washington took Hamilton's side on the issue when the latter said that the nation was not strong enough, and they had to give limits. Hamilton's opponents conceded defeat though they reminded Hamilton that Washington would not be president forever. </p>
      
      <p> Later, Jefferson, Madison, and Burr, all talk about how nice it must be if Washington were on your side. Soon enough, Jefferson decides to run for president, and Washington steps down. Washington says that he must step down for the betterment of the nation and to create a nation that will outlive them.  </p>

      <p> After this, James Madison wins as the next president. Here, one of the first things he does is fire Hamilton. Madison and Jefferson are delighted by the power they hold together now. At the same time, these people also accused Hamilton of embezzlement during his time in the US treasury. Hamilton denies these allegations, and he admits his affair with Maria Reynolds. He then decides to write the Reynolds Pamphlet where he admits his affair in writing. Hamilton's enemies celebrate over this as he would never be president now. At the same time, Angelica gets extremely furious with him and talks about he truly would never be satisfied. Eliza reacts by burning all the letters and 'erasing herself from the narrative'. </p>
      <p> The next part follows Philip (Hamilton's son) as a grown man. He is now charming and intelligent like his father, and he is protective of his father. However, when George Eacker mocks his father, Philip ends up sealing his doom. He goes to duel with the young man, and he gets shot. Eliza and Alexander are with him hoping he gets cured, but he ends up dying. Both parents are in utter despair about the entire situation. Hamilton then begs for forgiveness from Eliza, and they reconcile. They try to live a quiet life uptown. </p>
      
        <p> However, some time later, the elections of 1800 are occuring. Hamilton must decide who his vote would be between Jefferson and Burr. He decides to vote Jefferson due to the fact that Jefferson actually has a voice on issues. Here, Burr realized that Hamilton caused each of his failures, and Hamilton is to blame. Burr decides to challenge him to a duel - one that would make history. </p>
      
        <p> Before the duel, Eliza finds Hamilton writing. Eliza urges Hamilton to come back to sleep, but Hamilton continues. He finishes his conversation by telling his wife that she was 'the best of wives and women'. In the duel, Burr ends up killing Hamilton. Burr reflects about how his entire life will be punished in history books due to this. </p> 
      
        <p> The ending song of the musical focuses on commemorating Hamilton and his part in history. It begins with his political allies and opponents and their thoughts on him. Then, it follows Eliza's narration. Eliza dedicated the rest of her life to Hamilton's name. She made sure that Hamilton's name would not be forgotten in history books. In the end, she is excited to once again meet Hamilton - her true love - at her death. </p>
