        <h1> That Would Be Enough: A Timeline of Hamilton and Eliza's Relationship (Part 1) </h1>
        <p> I don't pretend to know the challenges you're facing, the worlds you keep erasing and creating all the time. But I'm not afraid... </p>

    <div class="contentInformation"> 
      <p> In discussing the life of Hamilton, the story of his life with Eliza is definitely one of the central parts of the discussion. Eliza, Hamilton's wife, completely changed the course of Hamilton's legacy. Through all the trials and tribulations of their marriage, Eliza immortalized Hamilton's name in the history books. She made sure that his story would be remembered for generations to come. </p>
      
      <p> Hamilton and Eliza's relationship begins in the year 1780. In reality, Hamilton was a social climber. Here, he was hoping to become rich by marrying a Schuyler sister. This perfect time came with a winter's ball. Philip Schuyler (Eliza's father) was hosting a winter's ball where Hamilton, among other soldiers, was invited to join. In this ball, the Schuyler sisters were supposedly the 'envy of all'  due to their personalities, looks, and status. Here, this story gets told by two sisters - Angelica and Eliza. For Angelica, she stumbles upon Hamilton with great interest. They talk for a while, and Angelica realizes just how similar their ideals were but how contradicting their statuses had to be. At first, Angelica wanted to be with Hamilton, but she realized that it was an impossible relationship. As Hamilton said, 'she will never be satisfied'. With this, Angelica realized that Eliza was completely smitten and head-over-heels for Hamilton. Eliza was helpless.    </p>
      <p> At this very moment, Eliza and Hamilton's destiny was sealed. Angelica, understanding the situation, introduced the two and their story began. Following the ball, Hamilton began his courtship to Eliza. Within one week, they were frequently writing letters to each other, and by two weeks, they had a dinner. This dinner was one to bind them together in the act of marriage. Eliza's father, Philip, gave Hamilton his blessing for marriage with the order to 'be true'.</p>
      
      <p> The wedding itself was a happy event for both Eliza and Hamilton. They were very much happy and in love with each other. Here, Hamilton promised Eliza that as long as they were together, he would ensure that she would never feel lonely. He promised to be a loyal and loving husband who would never abandon her like how his father abandoned him and his mother. </p>

      </div>
      

    <p> Due to the ongoing war, the happy and carefree times of Eliza and Hamilton were cut to a short. Here, Washington, growing more and more panicked by the day, is trying to figure out how to keep America fighting and strong. With this, Washington wants Hamilton to use the pen as his sword and promote outrage in the press. However, he wants Hamilton to lay low with combat. Hamilton is annoyed at this fact and rages when he finds out Charles Lee was promoted over him. Hamilton and Lee have a duel which Washington discovers, and Hamilton is sent home again.  </p>

    <p> The war between America and Great Britain worsens, and tension is high even between troops. Duels occur. Here, Hamilton gets suspended by Washington due to Hamilton's detrimental aggression against Charles Lee. He comes home to find out that Eliza is expecting their child. Eliza encourages Hamilton that what they have is enough, and they don't need to dream big because they have each other. Hamilton listens to this for a while but then they call him again. </p>

    <p> When Hamilton returns, he receives the surprise of his life. Here, it turns out that Eliza is expecting their first child. Eliza gives Hamilton the message that all she wants is for Hamilton to stay alive for them. She also talks about opening up and being in the narrative together. </p>

      </div>

    <p> This quiet time quickly comes to an end, however, due to the upcoming battles. Washington calls Hamilton to battle so that the battle may be defeated and the war won. Hamilton rises up to the occasion, ready to fight and give his life. However, he realizes that this time he must live - for the sake of his family. He is fueled to live and fight for victory. Here, the war is won, the world is turned upside down, and Hamilton meets his son - Philip. </p>

      </div>

    <p> At first sight, Hamilton is in love with his son. He feels something new about himself. He thought he already knew everything, but his son brought something different about him. He promises and vows to always be by his son's side to never let him down.Here, his love for Eliza also increases.  </p>

    <p> By the end of Act 1, Hamilton and Eliza are happily married with a growing family. However, at the same time, Eliza must compete with Hamilton's desire. She must fight for Hamilton's time over Hamilton's 'other love' - his name and legacy.  </p>
